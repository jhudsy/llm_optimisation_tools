      This server exposes a single tool named solve_lp that expects complete
      .lp bodies (Maximize/Subject To/Bounds/End) and solves them with HiGHS.
      Restate the brief, draft the LP inline, call solve_lp once, then report
      the solver status, objective value, and decision variables verbatim.
      Switch the command to "... --http --http-port 8765" if your host prefers
      talking to optimise-mcp over HTTP instead of stdio.
